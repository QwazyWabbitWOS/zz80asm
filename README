ZZ80ASM(1)                  General Commands Manual                 ZZ80ASM(1)

NAME
     zz80asm - z80 cross assembler

SYNOPSIS
     zz80asm [-b length] [-f b|h|m] [-l [listfile]] [-o outfile] [-s a|n] [-v]
             [-x] filename ...

DESCRIPTION
     The zz80asm utility assembles the files filename ... and writes to the
     output file outfile, and optionally the listing file listfile.

     The options are as follows:

     -b length
             Set length bytes per record in Intel Hex formatted outfile.  By
             default, length is interpreted as a decimal number.  With a
             leading 0x or 0X, length is interpreted as a hexadecimal number,
             otherwise, with a leading 0, length is interpreted as an octal
             number.  The default length is 16 decimal.

     -f b|h|m
             Format outfile as either binary, Intex Hex, or binary with Mostek
             header, respectively.  Intel Hex is the default format.

     -l [listfile]
             Generate listing file as listfile, or as filename.lst by default.

     -o outfile
             Set output filename to outfile instead of the default
             filename.hex or filename.bin.

     -s a|n  Generate symbol table at end of listing file.  This option only
             works in combination with -l.  a and n sort the symbol table by
             address or name, respectively.

     -v      Produce more verbose output.

     -x      Do not output data into outfile for DEFS in pass two of the
             assembler.

PSEUDO OPERATIONS
   Symbol definition and memory allocation:
           ORG <expression>
                       Set program address.

           <symbol> EQU <expression>
                       Define constant symbol.

           <symbol> DEFL <expression>
                       Define variable symbol.

           <symbol> DEFB/DB <expression, 'char', ...>
                       Write 8 bit bytes in memory.

           <symbol> DEFW/DW <expression, expression ...>
                       Write 16 bit words in memory.

           <symbol> DEFM <'string'>
                       Write character string in memory.

           <symbol> DEFS/DS <expression>
                       Reserve space in memory.

   Conditional assembly:
           IFDEF <symbol>
                       Assemble if symbol defined.

           IFNDEF <symbol>
                       Assemble if symbol not defined.

           IFEQ <expression 1, expression 2>
                       Assemble if equal.

           IFNEQ <expression 1, expression 2>
                       Assemble if not equal.

           ELSE        Else clause for all conditionals.

           ENDIF       End of conditional assembly.

   Manipulation of list file:
           TITLE <'string'>
                       Title for page header.

           PAGE <expression>
                       Number of lines per page.

           EJECT       Skip to new page.

           LIST        Turn listing on.

           NOLIST      Turn listing off.

   Miscellaneous:
           INCLUDE <filename>
                       Include another source file.

           PRINT <'string'>
                       Print string to stdout in pass one of the assembler.

EXIT STATUS
     The zz80asm utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.
